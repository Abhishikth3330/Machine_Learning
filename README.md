Basic Machine Learning Algorithms :
1. Linear Regression

Analyzing Regression is a form of predictive modelling technique.
It will look for relation of dependent variable and independent variable

**Why Linear Regression**
We need Regression to answer some phenomenons influences other variables.
Sometimes these changes are minor and we require Machine Learning Models to predict the change in variables.

Linear Regression is one of the easiest statistical models in Machine Learning(ML).


**Packages**
1. NumPy
2. Matplotlib
3. Scikit Learn

**Basic Linear Regression**
This File focuses on Linear Regression Model without an external Dataset.
Array's X and Y were created and LR Model was fitted.

**Linear Regression with Dataset**
This File focuses on Linear Regression Model with Dataset.
The dataset >> Height-Weight Dataset (data.csv)
We have Predicted Weight using Linear Regression Model.(User Defined Height is provided)
